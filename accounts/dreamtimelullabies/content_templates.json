Maximum 12 words. This should feel relatable and slightly humorous, not boastful. Use lowercase for casual tone.\n\nSlide 2 (BEFORE): No text overlay. This slide will show the \"before\" state visually.\n\nSlide 3 (AFTER): No text overlay. This slide will show the \"after\" state visually, demonstrating clear transformation.\n\nCaption: Write using AIDA framework:\n- Attention: Hook with the transformation result (1 sentence)\n- Interest: Mention the time period, challenge, or what changed (1 sentence)\n- Desire: Tease that you tracked/documented what worked (1 sentence)\n- Action: End with a soft CTA mentioning Parent Playbook and link in bio.
